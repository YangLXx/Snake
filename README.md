# Snake
 This project focuses on the famous Snake game. The current version is just a very simple implementation of the basic rules. 

 ## Update plans
 * Improve the scoring system, making score visible in real time. 
 * Add start screen and restart button on game over. 
 * Speed up the game as score progresses. 
 * Improve graphics. 

 ## Possible developments
 * Develop into a multi-player game, which allows multiple snakes and foods on the same grid at the same time. 
 * Increase the complexity of the game, such as the tarrain system and diversed food system etc., which will have various influence on the snake's behavior. 
 * Build AIs based on different strategies.
